    Using rx_main as an iterator in a for loop is a very clean and idiomatic way to receive all messages.
    However, it's important to understand how this loop behaves, as it's different from iterating over a Vec.
    This loop will block if the channel is temporarily empty and wait for the next message to arrive.
    It does not stop just because the channel is empty.
    The loop will only terminate and allow the program to continue to the next line when
    all Senders (tx and tx1 in this example) have been dropped, which signals that
    no more messages will ever be sent.
